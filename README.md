# Lung Nodules classification based on Radiomics and ResNet101 features
## Description
Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in both men and women that afflicts 225,500 people a year in the United States. Nearly 1 out of 4 cancer deaths are from lung cancer, more than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined. Early detection of the cancer can allow for early treatment which significantly increases the chances of survival. 
This project creates an algorithm that automatically detects candidate nodules and predicts the probability that the lung will be diagnosed with cancer within 1 year of the CT scans. This project aims to 
* Extracting quantitative, radiomics features from lung CT 3D images. 
* Extracting features of same data by fine-tuning a pre-trained deep CNN model (ResNet101).
* Training a machine learning model using the extracted features to classify lung cancer.
* Concatenating the Radiomics and deep CNN features and analyzing the performance of the classification model.
* Carefully analyzing the results of the classification model to determine the most effective feature extraction method.
