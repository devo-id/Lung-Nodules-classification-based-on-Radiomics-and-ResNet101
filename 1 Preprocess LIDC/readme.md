### lidc2dicom.py
This program will parse the DICOM and XML data for LIDC subject specified and generate DICOM representation for the segmentations and evaluations of the segmented nodule.


### Requirements
All requirements are given in ```requirements.txt```

**pylidc** looks in your home folder for a configuration file called, .pylidcrc on Mac and Linux, or pylidc.conf on Windows. 

You must create this file. On Linux and Mac, the file should be located at **/home/[user]/.pylidcrc***. 

On Windows, the file should be located at **C:Users[User]pylidc.conf**.

The configuration file should be formatted as follows:
```
[dicom]
path = /path/to/big_external_drive/datasets/LIDC-IDRI
warn = True
```

`usage: lidc2dicom.py  --subjects <LIDC_subjectID>`

options:
|                ||
|----------------|-------------------------------|
|`-h`, `--help`|show this help message and exit
|`--subject-range`|Range of subject identifiers to be processed. Overrides individual subjects specified.
|`--all-subjects`|Process all subjects (up to 1012). Overrides all other subject specifications.|
|`--subjects` SUBJECTIDS [SUBJECTIDS ...]|Identifier(s) (separated by space) of the subject to be processed.|
|`--log` LOGFILE|Location of the file to store processing log.|
|`--output-dir` OUTPUTDIR |Directory for storing the results of conversion.|
|`--composite`|Make composite objects (1 SEG and 1 SR that contain all segmentations/measurement for all nodes/annotations). Composite objects will not be generated by default.|
|`--skip`  | Do not encode empty slices in the DICOM SEG objects. Empty slices will not be skipped by default.|
|`--images-dir` IMAGESDIR| Directory with the CT images of the LIDC-IDRI collection. The directory should be organized following this pattern:
                    <subject ID>/<study UID>/<series UID>

            

### Usage
```
run the batch.py file and specify the range for the number of subjects.
```

### Input
```
This script will create result folder (Which we will use for later use, named as Data folder) having equivalent image and its segmentations in NRRD format.
```

### Output
```
This script will create result folder (Which we will use for later use, named as 0 Data folder) having equivalent image and its segmentations in NRRD format.
```
